            <p>The computing innovation I chose is dark web. The purpose of the dark web is an anonymous network that you can't be tracked on. It could be used for the only the people that know how to access it can sell drugs or weapons and buy other drugs
                or weapons and terrorist use this network to communicate to plan atrasties(1). The creators were the government and they use it to spy on people back in the 90’s(2). The impact on society of using the dark web is that the government can
                not track you because tor keeps you anonymous; thus, people will safe doing illegal activities on the dark web because they wont fear that they cant get arrested.
            </p>


            <p>One benefit of the dark web is that the government won't be able to track you like let's say you're undocumented and you don't want the government to find you or track your location. This is important because you are safe if no one knows who
                you are if you use the dark web and they can't see where your location. The government has no access to this network on hackers and criminals. A harm that's on the dark web is that people can buy and sell drugs they can even buy weapons
                they do human trafficking. The impact on the society is that people buy drugs on the dark web are encouraged to proceed with their drug addiction because they have access to buy drugs easily.
            </p>


            <p>The data my innovation uses is plaintext Http requests for .onion websites. The Http request data is transformed by Tor by scrambling the data through random virtual tunnels. The purpose of transforming the HTTP request data is to keep people
                anonymous in the dark web. A data security concern is that if you use tor to browse the dark web you can still be tracked even though it's supposed to be anonymous. This is concerning because they can track your browsing history when you
                think your browsing anonymously.(9)
